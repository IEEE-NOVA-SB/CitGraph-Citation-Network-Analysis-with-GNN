# CitGraph-Citation-Network-Analysis-with-GNN
CitGraph employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze citation networks, specifically focusing on node classification tasks. Leveraging PyTorch Geometric and the Planetoid dataset, this project aims to classify nodes within citation graphs, offering insights into citation patterns and relationships.
